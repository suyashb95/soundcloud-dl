# soundcloud-dl
[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/soundcloud-dl)](https://pepy.tech/project/soundcloud-dl)

A small command-line program to download tracks from soundcloud.com

You'll need to get an API key since there are rate limits on streams

## Installation

#### Using Pip
* Run `pip install soundcloud_dl`

#### From Source
* Clone the repo or download the zip
* Make sure you have pip installed
* `cd` to the folder
* `pip install -r "requirements.txt"`

### Getting an API key
* SoundCloud has stopped registering apps so the only way to get an API key is from the dev console 
  Navigate to soundcloud.com and check for any XHR request params to find a `client_id` that can be used
* Use `sc-dl --set-api-key <CLIENT_ID>` to set the API key

* sc-dl can be used instead of soundcloud-dl
* The -u/--url option can be a link to a user, a track or a user's playlists. 
If it's a user profile, all uploads are fetched unless --all or --likes options are specified
* `--top`, `--new` and `--url` arguments are mutually exclusive
* Adding the --include option overrides the --exclude option
* Example : `sc-dl https://soundcloud.com/aaasrith --dir D:\Music`
* Example : `sc-dl https://soundcloud.com/aaasrith --dir D:\Music --exclude 1 2 3`
* Example : `sc-dl https://soundcloud.com/aaasrith/closurewithaclause -s`
